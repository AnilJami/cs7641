1.1 Well-posed learning problems
--------------------------------

Given a machine, let $P(T, E)$ be the performance of that machine at
task $T$ given experience $E$. If $P(T, E') > P(T, E)$, then the machine
has **learned** more from experience $E'$ than experience $E$.

An alternative interpretation.

If $E' > E$ implies $P(T, E') > P(T, E)$, then the machine has
**learned**.
