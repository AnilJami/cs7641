Lesson 2: Regression & Classification
=====================================

What is regression?
-------------------

The term regression became overloaded over time. Initially it described how children of very tall people and children of very short people tended both to be a bit closer average height than their parents.

The "function" child_height(parent_height) looks like a line and has slope less than 1.
